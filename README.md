By Liliang Zhang, Liang Lin, Xiaodan Liang, Kaiming He

### Introduction

This code is relative to an [arXiv tech report](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497), which is also accepted on ECCV 2016.

The RPN code in this repo is written based on the MATLAB re-implementation of Faster R-CNN. Details about Faster R-CNN are in: [ShaoqingRen/faster_rcnn](https://github.com/ShaoqingRen/faster_rcnn).

This BF code in this repo is written based on Piotr's Image & Video Matlab Toolbox. Details about Piotr's Toolbox are in: [pdollar/toolbox](https://github.com/pdollar/toolbox).

This code has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 with MATLAB 2014b.
